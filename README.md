# BlinkyGlasses

This is my first attempt at using SiliconLabs EFM8 processor in one of my projects. This uses the EFM8BB10F2G QFN package.
I used this in video #26 https://youtu.be/TqlV438xtmo where I try to trigger a migraine by strobing LEDs at a few different frequencies. If you're interested in the schematic, it is provided in that video.
